# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

An interactive 3D solar system simulation built using **Three.js**. This project visually demonstrates the orbits and scales of the planets in our solar system with smooth animations and responsive controls.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic orbiting of all 8 planets around the sun
- Scaled distances and speeds (approximate for visual effect)
- Interactive camera with zoom and pan
- Light source emulating sunlight from the sun
- Speed control slider for real-time orbit speed adjustment
- Responsive and optimized for modern browsers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Three.js** – WebGL-based 3D rendering
- **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**
- Optional UI controls (e.g., dat.GUI, sliders)
